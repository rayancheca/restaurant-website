            <p>Part café, part market, FOOD was designed to be a go-to neighborhood gathering place with quality cuisine and new kitchen essentials, the ultimate destination for dining in or taking out. Established in 2007 to “serve” the community, FOOD
                offers a smart, sophisticated menu of tasty morning meals, savory entrees and soups, signature salads and sandwiches, sides and house-made sweets, complemented by distinctive daily specials showcasing seasonal farmers’ market produce.
                Of course, if you prefer to dine at home, FOOD offers everyday items to stock your larder and select ingredients to create a home-cooked meal—as well as prepared dishes, unique snacks, cheeses and wines to help you create a complete take-home
                meal or supplement your own home cooking.&nbsp;We also offer&nbsp;Catering&nbsp;services!</p>

        <h2><span style="color: #f73223;">FOOD&nbsp;INSPIRATION</span></h2>
        <div style="float: left; width: 60%;">
            <p>In 1971 Gordon Matta-Clark co-founded Food, in SoHo, New York, a restaurant managed and staffed by artists. The first of its kind in SoHo, Food became well known among artists and was a central meeting- place for groups such as the Philip
                Glass Ensemble, Mabou Mines, and the dancers of Grand Union.</p>
            <p><em>“Being good in business is the most fascinating kind of art. Making money is art and working is art and good business is the best art.”</em> <strong>– Andy Warhol</strong></p>
